4 Different languages will be covered: λ-calculus (lambda calculus), Scheme, Haskell and Prolog

λ-calculus forms the basis of particular languages like Scheme.

Scheme is a dialect of Lisp, a group of programming languages designed by "fun" people 
Whereas a language like COBOL is designed by work people.
Scheme is fun! 
It is a "small" language with "small" constraints.
There are no types in Scheme.
Scheme is a reified languages - a language which makes concrete concepts.

Another language we will learn is Haskell.
Haskell has types.
It has an elaborate syntax - tries to be programming in math which is seen as pure.

The last language we will learn is Prolog, this stands for Programming and Logic.

There are many different paradigms and computational approaches in the languages' construstion.
Alan Turing showed λ-calculus was turing equivalent.

Languages about base and assignment have troubles proving properties.

λ-calculus and Scheme are functional. They are good at assembling arguements and calling functions.

Prolog is an example of a Logic Program.
Logic programs work by; 
1) Giving a list of axioms.
2) Giving a hypothesis.
3) Using Theorem proving.

An example of prolog code:
father(barak,ziva).
parent(x,y):-
  father(x,y).
parent(x,y):-
  mother(x,y).
grandparent(x,y):- parent(x,y),parent(x,y).

Prolog is good for puzzle solving, games to decide moves to make and grammatical stuff.

Scheme is the darling of lisp, lisp was a god of functional languages and was good for lists an for use in AI.

These languages are expressive, however, they are not as robust as other languages like Java and its objects.
To get around this you will see the use of things called monads and monad transformations which will make your code more robust 
and allow you to structure your programs nicely.

Ada Lovelace wrote the first computer program under Charles Babbage.
Konrad Zuse wwas the first person to implement and run a computer program. 
He designed a program language, assembler and floating point.
Jon Von Neumann is also someone you may want to look into.

Snobol was a language based on string substition and search

example of an assignment language - COBOL

Next lecture 21/09/2017
Will begin learning Scheme.
